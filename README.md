# Pterodactyl-Themes
Here is a selection of themes for Pterodactyl!

## Can i use them?
Sure! All of the themes you see below are made for you to take and change for your own personal projects! Or if you like them already you can keep them as they are!

## How do i use them?
Each Theme has a small code snippet that you must run inside the Pterodactyl panel directory, this is normal located at `/var/www/html/pterodactyl/` The implementation command will take a backup of your current panel incase anything goes wrong during the theme change! So you dont need to worry about losing anything you already made!

## Themes Ready for you to use:
### Graphite
A Simple Change from Blue to Black!
